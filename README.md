#Expecation from the project--

application must enable the creation and update functions for any of the attributes of concern. It will be okay to assume each of these questions is a button on the left/right side of the screen depending on your design. Also, a configuration file enables the creation of multiple instances of cars with various characteristics consistent with the requirements above. This will save you from having to retype the same thing multiple times. Make sure to create enough variations to enable a good demo of your solution. Checkboxes should be used to indicate yes or no answers to certain attributes such as availability, etc. The ability to update some of these attributes is required as well.

The UI design will be considered in grades.

Data Validation Requirements:

Not-null check. Some attributes of cars used for creating & updating cannot be null.
Some attributes should be unique.
